# Navigating the Platform
After logging in, you are taken to the Pelion **Home Page**. The **Home Page** provides you with a snapshot of the status of your account. Elements such as the **Search Bar** allow you to search for specific subscribers, users, help documentation and other information. You can also use the status buttons at the top of the screen to see information such as how much stock you have in your inventory or how many of your subscribers are online.

You can return to the **Home Page** at any time by clicking on the Pelion logo in the top left-hand corner of the page or by clicking on the word **Home** in the breadcrumb trail at the top of the page. You can access other sections of the platform using the navigation panel at the left-hand side of the page.
